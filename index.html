         <p>My story begins when i was trying to earn my final Wilderness Explorer merit badge "assisting the elderly" so that i could become a senior Wilderness Explorer. This is where I met Carl Fredrickson. A grumpy old man who looked like he needed assistance. giving him assistance however proved to be quite dificult
            as he did not want any of my help at first. Then after to some persistance he finally agreed to my help with an important mission. A Snipe hunt! he told me I'd have to clap my hands three times to lure the snipe in. he then sent me 2 bloacks away to where he believe it's burrow was. 
            I ended up finding a few days later. it had a long tail and looked more like a mouse than he described but i ended up following it to Mr.Fredrickson's house.

         <div><p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Then all of a sudden the house began to float over the city! It was being held up by 1000s of balloons! this was not as fun to me at the time as I am scared of heights 
            and and we where very high up! holding on for dear life a made my way from the underside of his house to the front door. 
            He eventually let me in and i found out we were going to paradise falls. A legendary place in South America. I was excited for our journey until we ran into a storm. The high winds caused the house to shake greatly
            and it was very scary but, as luck would have it we managed to make it though the storm! We had made it to paradise falls!

         <p>We landed in the wrong spot so we have to move the house to the other side of the falls. while moving the house i had to go to the bathroom. after doing my business I found snipe tracks! I follow the tracks and end up finding a snipe! He was a huge colorful bird! I ended up naming him Kevin.
            I was showed Kevin to Mr. Fredrickson and he seemed surprised. I ended convincing Mr. Fredrickson to let Kevin stay and we resumed our journey. after a few more hours of walking we met someone else. A talking dog named Dug! Dug is a very smart and nice golden retriever who could also do tricks.
            As it turns out Dug has a collor made by his mysterious master that allows him to talk. Dug was on a special mission from his master to find a bird. He was on a mission to find Kevin. Dug really wanted to take Kevin prisioner but we wouldn't let him. Mr. Fredrickson was annoyed by the three of us so he he tricked Kevin and Dug into the Jungle away from us but they immedietly found their way back to us.

         <p>Me and Mr. Fredrickson set up camp for the night and bond over the campfire and he promises to keep Kevin safe. In the morning we find Kevin on the roof all calling to his babies, turns out kevins a girl!
            Kevin goes into the Jungle to take care of her babies but Mr. Fredrickson wont let us go after her to help despite our promise. All of a sudden right after Kevin left aggresive talking dogs show up looking for Kevin. Since they can't find Kevin the force us to go with them to thier master!
            we follow the dogs and are eventually surrounded by dozens of dogs until the master shows up! He ends up being some old adverturer guy named Charles Muntz that Mr.Fredrickson was a fan of. It ended up being a misunderstanding and he let us inside his base. it was full of artifacts from all his adventures.
            we end up having dinner made by the dogs and Mr. Muntz talks about his biggest regret. The snipe! He shows us a bird skeleton and I let him know it looks like Kevin

         <p>The dinner get kinda akward after that and Mr.muntz starts talking about all the people who tried to trick him over the years &#9760;. Suddenly Kevin lets out a cry in the distance and Mr. Muntz sends out his dogs. Thats when me and Mr. F make our escape! We make it to the house with Kevin and Dug and use it to go down a rocky hill. Dug tries to stop the dogs from chasing us but he is unsuccesful. the dogs continue to chase us through the valley until we use the house to float over a ravine with Kevin but just as we take of Kevin gets bit in the leg and shes unable to walk.
            that's when we decide to help Kevin home. After a few hours of walking Kevin home just when we thought we were free Mr. Muntz manages to find us and captures Kevin! and sets fire to Mr. Fredrickson's house! Mr. Fredrickson left with a choice of either saving Kevin or Saving his house Mr. Fredrickson chooses to save his house and let Kevin be taken. After Kevin is taken I as why he let Kevin be taken he yells and me and Dug when he tries to console him as he is his new master.
            we end up contining on the the falls. After just barely making to the falls as the house is finally too heavy to move I throw my badge sashe at Mr. F and tell him I dont want it anymore and I go look for Kevin on my own! I grab a leaf blower and some balloons from the roof and set off leaving Mr.F and Dug behind! I ended up catching up to Mr. Muntz's airship but i get captured immedietly. Mr. Muntz ties me up and dangles me out of his airship and I am just barely saved by Mr. Fredrickson. He had come to help me! He leaves me tied up in the floating house. I don't know how he got it 
            floating again but i do know i need to get untied and go save Kevin. I manage to wiggle my way out of the chair but i end up falling barely catching by self with the garden house dangling below the house. Mr Muntz's dogs then come out of the airship in planes to try to shoot me and the house down. The airship then Begins to tilt and I see Kevin, Mr. Fredrickson, and Mr. Muntz climbing the side of the airship. I trick the dog pilots in to crashing by telling them there was a squirrel and climb up the hose to pick up Kevin and Mr. Fredrickson by just as we were getting away a gunshot rings out 
            popping some of the ballons landing it on top of the airship. Mr. Muntz then comes into the house and tries to take Kevin but Mr. Fredrickson climbs Kevin and leads her out of the house with chocolate her favorite food. Mr. Muntz tries to jump after them but he get caught in some of the balloon strings. the string break and he falls. He had a few balloons attached to his ankle so im sure he's fine. we ended up not being able to make it back to the house and it floats off. Mr. Fredrickson doesn't seems to be that upset this time over it though. We take Kevin home and fly home in the airship! 
            Soon after we make it home its time for my Wilderness Explorers badge cerimony and Mr. Fredrickson presents me my badge in place of my deadbeat father! Instead of the assisting the elderly badge he gives me his  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtY512Euakg"> dead wife's </a> badge. I think it still counted though.
